#A Kingdom Collection mod
#This code is obfuscated, but not in bad faith.  I am very open to cooperation but do not use my work for deriving work without permission.
#For any legal reasons e.g. if you believe the mod includes any work without the consent of that modder, the non-obfuscated version will be provided.
#If the mod stops beeing maintained, it will be made open-source.
#Contact: Best over Discord Reloader#6504 or as last resort contact another contributor.
